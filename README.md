### Hello, I'm frg2089

I'm a amateur coder.  
![frg2089's github stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=frg2089&show_icons=true&theme=midnight-purple&count_private=true)  
I'm Chinese and my english is terrible.  

I sometimes will to make some toys to help me do somethings easy.  
My favorite programming language is C# for .Net, Kotlin for JVM and TypeScript for node.js.  
![frg2089's Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=frg2089&theme=midnight-purple&exclude_repo=frg2089.github.io&layout=compact)

I like Back-End because I can don't care about how user to view that.  
I cannot design. So I cannot design a beautiful UI.  
But the Back-End, I can don't care that.  

My favorite Command Shell is PowerShell Core.
Because it is base on .Net platform.  
I can make a ClassLib for .Net and used on PowerShell.
But I dislike Windows PowerShell.  
I think it's background is not beautiful.  
Black Window is No.1 in the World! Right?

I like Dark theme. Light theme is too light for me.  
So Black Window is No.1 in the World!
